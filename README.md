# Anthony Fu's Skills

A curated collection of [agent skills](https://agentskills.io/home) reflecting [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu)'s preferences, experience, and best practices, along with usage documentation for the tools.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a proof-of-concept project for generating agent skills from source documentation and keeping them in sync.
> I haven't fully tested how well the skills perform in practice, so feedback and contributions are welcome.
